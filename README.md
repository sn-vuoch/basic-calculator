# Basic PHP Calculator

A simple web-based calculator built using PHP, HTML, and CSS. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations directly in their browser.

## Features
* **Four Basic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Input Validation:** Checks if inputs are empty or if the user is attempting to divide by zero.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, dark-themed interface that works on both mobile and desktop screens.
* **Secure Handling:** Uses PHP filtering to sanitize user inputs.

## Project Structure
* `index.php`: The main file containing the HTML structure and the PHP logic for calculations.
* `css/styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the calculator's appearance.
* `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions.

## How to Run
